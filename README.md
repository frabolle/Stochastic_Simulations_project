# Stochastic approximation in mathematical finance

In the following project I used Robbins Monro and Monte Carlo algorithms to extract volatility firstly from the European put option and then from Asian put option.

To improve the performances of Monte Carlo algorithm I used also Importance Sampling to be more efficient in the estimation of the option price.

## Environment
the project has been developed with `python 3.8`.
